## Getting Started

To start a new project using this boilerplate, follow these steps:

### Assets

Download the assets folder, and insert it in your root directory of your project.
There, you can set all the images that you want to use in your app, and the font family of your preference.

### Dependencies

1. Add the required packages to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     # Add other dependencies here
     ```

2. Add the required code in your 'pubspec.yaml' file, to make use of your assets folder

   ```
    assets:
      - ./assets/images/

    fonts:
      - family: Manrope
        fonts:
          - asset: assets/fonts/Manrope-Regular.ttf
          - asset: assets/fonts/Manrope-Medium.ttf
            weight: 500
          - asset: assets/fonts/Manrope-Bold.ttf
            weight: 700
    ```

 Run flutter pub get to install the dependencies.
