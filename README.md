## Getting Started

To start a new project using this boilerplate, follow these steps:

### Assets

Download the assets folder, and insert it in your root directory of your project.
There, you can set all the images that you want to use in your app, and the font family of your preference.

### Dependencies

1. Add the required packages to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     # Add other dependencies here
     ```
     
    **Required Packages :**
    - [go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router/install)


2. Add the required code in your 'pubspec.yaml' file, to make use of your assets folder

   ```
    assets:
      - ./assets/images/

    fonts:
      - family: Manrope
        fonts:
          - asset: assets/fonts/Manrope-Regular.ttf
          - asset: assets/fonts/Manrope-Medium.ttf
            weight: 500
          - asset: assets/fonts/Manrope-Bold.ttf
            weight: 700
    ```

 Run flutter pub get to install the dependencies.
 
 ## Boilerplate Examples
 
There are four distinct boilerplate templates tailored to cater to various application requirements:

1. **No Login/Sign Up or Bottom Navbar:** This boilerplate template does not include either login/sign-up features or a bottom navigation bar, offering a clean and minimalistic starting point for your application.

2. **Bottom Navbar Only:** In this template, you'll find a bottom navigation bar for easy navigation, but there are no login or sign-up components.

3. **Login/Sign Up without Bottom Navbar:** This template provides login and sign-up features but omits the use of a bottom navigation bar.

4. **Login/Sign Up with Bottom Navbar:** This template includes both login and sign-up functionalities, along with a bottom navigation bar.

| Template Name                | Login/Sign Up | Bottom Navbar |
|------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| No Login/Sign Up or Navbar   | No            | No            |
| Bottom Navbar Only           | No            | Yes           |
| Login/Sign Up without Navbar | Yes           | No            |
| Login/Sign Up with Navbar    | Yes           | Yes           |



All you have to do, is download the lib folder and replace it with the one in your project.
